I love the sun – especially in Spring when temperatures are not too hot and taking a sunbath is a real pleasure. And I love working in the sun, which is often a challenge because of the poor contrast - especially if, like me, you like to use dark themes.

Since I recently changed to [i3] as my window manager, I use [termite] as my default terminal which has by default no simple way to switch themes – at least not to my knowledge. But working in the sun requires a light theme, so I decided to work on a simple theme changer that is also integrated in i3.

So let's get to work.

First we need custom color themes. I have taken the two themes from [this GitHub repository][termite-solarized] and put them in `~/.config/termite/themes`.
Of course you can also define custom themes and put them there. The theme files should have the following format:

```ini
[colors]
foreground = #000000
background = #ffffff
# and so on
```

Then copy your current `~/.config/termite/config` to `~/.config/termite/config.base` and remove the `colors` section.

We will now need a way to append a theme file to the `config.base` file. I've created a simple script that does this job:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

USAGE="$0 light|dark"

TERMITE_CONF_FOLDER=~/.config/termite
THEME=$1

change_theme() {
    echo "# THIS FILE HAS BEEN AUTOGENERATED. DO NOT CHANGE MANUALLY!" | \
        cat - /tmp/termite-switch-theme.hint $TERMITE_CONF_FOLDER/config.base $TERMITE_CONF_FOLDER/themes/$1 > $TERMITE_CONF_FOLDER/config
    killall -USR1 termite || true
}

case $THEME in
    light|solarized-light) change_theme solarized-light ;;
    dark|solarized-dark) change_theme solarized-dark ;;
    *) echo $USAGE ;;
esac
```

Put this script somewhere and make it executable. In my case I've saved the file in `~/.local/scripts/termite-switch-theme.sh`. You should be able to switch themes now by calling the script, e.g. `~/.local/scripts/termite-switch-theme.sh` light.

This is already great, but for a perfect integration with i3 put these lines into your `~/.config/i3/config`:

```
set $mode_term_theme Terminal theme (l) light, (d) dark
mode "$mode_term_theme" {
    # choose which theme should be applied by pressing l (light) or d (dark)
    bindsym l exec --no-startup-id "~/.local/scripts/termite-switch-theme.sh light", mode "default"
    bindsym d exec --no-startup-id "~/.local/scripts/termite-switch-theme.sh dark", mode "default"
    # back to normal: Enter or Escape
    bindsym Return mode "default"
    bindsym Escape mode "default"
}
bindsym $mod+t mode "$mode_term_theme"
```

Finally reload the i3 config with `mod+shift+c`. Now you can change themes with `mod+t` and choose which theme should be applied (light or dark). All running terminals will immediately reflect your theme changes. Have fun!

## Base16 Themes

If you want to have even more themes to choose from take a look at the wonderful repository [khamer/base16-termite][base16-termite]. Those themes are working out-of-the-box just as described above.
