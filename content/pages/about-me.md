This place is a good start to learn more about me.
This site is my personal weblog and a way for people to get in touch with me.

## Sports 

Since I'm working in the tech business my typical working day does not include any kind of sports – except mental sport.
I try to make up for this misery by spending parts of my free time jogging or riding around on my cyclocross bike.
I love nature and try to stay away from roads and cities if possible and run through woods and forests and meadows.

## Technology

I do love technology – especially any tech that is related to the internet.
I'm fascinated about how human mankind created and maintains a global network where any individual can (theoretically) reach any other individual on this earth in a just a few milliseconds.
We believe it's normal and commodity but to me it's not.
To me it's one of the greatest achievements of mankind and we should be proud of it.
Also we should be aware of the responsibility that comes with it.
The internet should stay a place where everyone can share their ideas and thoughts and where everyone can learn from each other.
We should not allow any single entity to control the internet or information that is shared on the internet.

I have worked in several jobs so far.
I would call myself an all-rounder who loves to learn new stuff that is related to technology by any means.
Jobs in the past included:

- Working as a Frontend Web Developer (mostly on a React/Typescript based stack)
- Working as a FullStack Web Developer (mostly on a Python/FastAPI/React/Typescript based stack)
- Working as a Data Engineer Trainer
- Working as a DevOps Engineer (mostly on a Kubernetes based stack)

The best part about my job is that I love it so much that I also do it privately.
Whenever I have some spare time I try to learn new stuff or improve my skills in the tech field.

## Teaching

Part of my professional life has always been to educate colleagues or train/mentor other people along my own learning path and share the fun of learning new stuff.
I love to teach because it helps me to understand things better.
I use the [Feynman technique][feynman-technique] whenever possible to learn new stuff and can highly recommend it to others.

## Open Source

I count myself as an Open Source advocate.
Most of the software that I have privately developed in the past has been released under an Open Source license.
I think the world needs to share more ideas, more code and more of the good stuff in order to make the world a better place.

Unfortunately this is not true for most of the code that I have developed professionally because most of the code is proprietary. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

## Social Media

I have used social media in the past but I have to admit that I have never been a big fan of it.
I'm not really interested in social media nowadays anymore.
In general I think it does harm society more than it does good and I try to stay away from it as much as possible.
Sometimes I read or post on [Mastodon][mastodon] though where you can find me on the [Fosstodon][fosstodon] instance.
But to be honest, I'm not very active there.

## Computers

Well, I guess I have way too many of them right now.
But these are the main devices that I use are currently:

- A Macbook Pro which I use as my developer notebook.
  Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-5287U CPU @ 2.90GHz with 2 cores, 16 GB RAM, 500 GB SSD.
  I used to use macOS for the notebook, but since Apple is lacking the high-quality support they have had in the past I decided to switch to Manjaro Linux some time ago.
  And I'm quite happy about this decision, ~~although unfortunately battery life has dropped significantly (but that might also be a coincidence with the battery which seems to be dying)~~[^1].
  I prefer Linux over macOS because of the freedom.
  I would probably not go back to macOS anymore and do not miss anything currently.
- A hand-made server which I use to self-host various things.
  Also runs a Linux operating system (Ubuntu Server).
  Specs: AMD Ryzen 3 2200G with 4 cores @ 3.50 GHz, 16 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD, 8 TB HDD.

[^1]: Since I changed from Gnome 3 to i3 and [later to Sway](/posts/migrate-from-i3-to-sway) battery life has again got much better and is no longer an issue.
  I guess it's a mixture between the real good power management of the Apple Macbook (> 500 loading cycles) and a not-so-energy-hungry operating system and window server.
